\section{Hypothesis Testing}

In statistics, a hypothesis is a conjecture about a population.

\begin{ex}[Coins]
    One hypothesis is that $P(\text{heads}) = 0.5$. Another hypothesis is $P(\text{heads}) \neq 0.5$.
\end{ex}

The status quo is called the \textbf{null hypothesis}. 

\begin{ex}[Die]
    $$H_0: P(1) = \frac{1}{6}$$
    $$H_1: P(6) > P(1)$$
\end{ex}

\begin{defn}
    A Type I error is a false positive, and a type II error is a false negative.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
    $$H_0: \mu = 1000$$
    $$H_1: \mu \neq 1000$$
    We have a sample $X_1,\dots,X_{25}$, $\sigma = 50$. Then we want to find the probability that the we have a Type I error. We reject $H_0$ if the sample mean deviates from $\mu$ by more than 10. Then the desired probability becomes
    $$P(\overline X < 990) + P(\overline X > 1010)$$
    Assuming a normal ditribution, note that $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{50}{\sqrt{25}} = 10$. Then the probability is
    $$P(Z < -1) + P(Z > 1) = 0.1587 \times 2 = 0.32$$
    which is quite high. If we want to reduce this, we can have a wider region or increase $n$.
\end{ex}
