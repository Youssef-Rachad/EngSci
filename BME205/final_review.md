### Point of Contact between nerve ending and muscle fibre
Neuromuscular Junction

### heart spends this fraction of time in diastole
2/3

### blood parameter measured by pulse oximeter
oxygen saturation

### subset of nervous system innervates smooth and cardiac muscles
autonomic

### volume of blood ejected from each ventricle during a contraction
stroke volume

### neurotransmitter; a strong vasoconstrictor when binding to alpha 1 adrenergic receptors
norepinephrine (epinephrine too)

### closure of these valves produces the first heart sound
atrioventricular valve

### Bundle of muscle fibres enclosed by a connective tissue sheath/perimysium
fascicle

### interval represents time taken for ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation
QT interval

### in contrast to cardiac muscles, the initiation of contraction in skeletal muscles uses this type of stimulation

### in addition to heart rate, sympathetic stimulation increases this, which leads to an increase in stroke volume
myocardial contractility/contraction force

### filling of the lungs with fluid as a result of climbing to a high altitude
pulminary

### subcellular organelle found in particularly high abundance in caardiac muscle cells, reflecting high energy demands
mitochondria

### This isoelectric segment represents the plateau phase of ventricular action potentials
ST


### binds to M2 muscarinic repectors in SA nodal cells and inhibits those cells
ACh

### wave represents atrial depolarisation
P wave

### receptors most responsible for measuring concentration of CO2
central chemoreceptors

### decrease of partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood is cause by this action
hyperventilation
