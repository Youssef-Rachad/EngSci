## Concept Map

### Requirements

- Draft
- Identify concepts (will not be complete)
- Define concepts
- Link concepts
	- Identify links/connection
	- Describe the nature of the connection

### Map

- Thought
	- Meaning in brain
- Speech
	- Spoken
	- Written
	- Social: with others, intended to transmit meaning
		- Alien words: same words mean different things (and different sense), so listener may get different message
	- Inner: self, stresses on psychological subject
		- e.g. if go then late -> even if I were to go right now, I would still be late

- Connection
	- Speech completes thought
		- Speech is (arguably) the only representation of thought others can understand
		- One can argue a thought is not well formed until it can be converted to speech (not that it has to be converted to speech in order to be well formed)
	- Speech transforms thought
		- in practice, some thought is lost when transformed to speech (can't find the right words)
		- Extra meaning could also be transmitted
			- trivial examples: gender, alien words
			- senses, e.g. imagery
