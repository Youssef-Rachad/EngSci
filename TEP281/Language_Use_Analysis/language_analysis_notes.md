Notes: Unless if prepended by a name, actions [in these brackets] are performed by the speaker. M refers to Matthew, D refers to Daniel, B refers to both. = refers to an interruption by another speaker. P refers to the speaker pointing at the concept map, XP refers to X pointing at the concept map, and PX refers to the speaker pointing at. L1 refers to looking at the other speaker, and L2 refers to looking behind the camera. H refers to a downwards motion of the hand, similar to how one's arm goes down when lifting weights with a single hand.

M: Let's see [finger on chin]
D: I think this connects to these [BP]
M: Didn't we connects the role
M: Fine you can say everything connect to it, like, but I feel like this [P] is more... it shapes like how you literally see [looks around], or like can think about the objects around you [M picks up post-it, D looks at it], or is that like = the idea [finger quotes] of linguistic relativity right?
D: = [P vigorously] Oh, no neutral words! [looks at M]
M: That makes sense. Although I feel like this is kind of different [hand on head], I mean it is pretty close =
D: = It demands a response, I feel like it's related [M leans back], in an opposite way
M: I feel like [P] this is a little bit removed this as well, like um, the idea of like a response [raises hands as if holding a ball], kind of differs from like "guides a social reality". [P] But then again it's social, so then [hand on chin] = this is like framing differently
D: Yeah, I don't, I guess basically [P] it kinda feel that [L2] um the way you think in [L2], ties into the meaning of language [P], and this is that language [L1]... demands a response
M: [L1] It demands a response, like from another agent, you mean?
D: [L1] Yeah, [L2] but... but the response doesn't have to be verbal, obviously
M: But still, from [rotates index finger in the direction upwards, forwards, downwards, backwards/along horizontal axis] =
D: So like, if you're saying something [PD] to me [PD], or if you're saying it to yourself [PD], you're [PD], actively using [P] language, to demand some sort of like response [leans forwards, P], and I feel like this ties into, this ties into how, like, this [L2] ties into how, how the language [H] you use, the language you speak in [H], is whatever you think is important, [L2] do you know what I mean? [H] Demands something like, for this course, everytime you introduce a [H] reading, there is a [H] reading response. So this [L1], almost entirely [H]  dictates [H] how you're using language and meaning = , because [H]
M: [leans forwards] But you mean language and meaning, but not necessarily like social reality [P]
