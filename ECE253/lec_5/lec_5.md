## Lecture 5

#### Announcements
First practical: 23/9 and 26/9
- Lab 1 posted
- pre lab quiz due 09:00 on first practical day
- Demonstrate working circuits in lab
- Online submission

#### Product of Sums
- Maxterms
	- Each maxterm includes $$\begin{cases} x_i & x_i = 0 \\ \text{if } \overline{x_i} & \text{if } x_i = 1 \\ \end{cases}$$
	- $f$ is equal to the product of the maxterms
- Both approaches work and are equivalent

#### Boolean Algebra
- Axioms
	- $0 \cdot 0 = 1$
	- $1 \cdot 1 = 1$
	- $0 \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot 0 = 0$
	- if $x = 0$, $\overline{x} = 1$
	- Duality: given a logic expression, we can swap 0 with 1 and $\cdot$ with + and the expression is still valid
