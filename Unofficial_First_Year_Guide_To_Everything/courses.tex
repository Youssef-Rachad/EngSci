\section{CIV102: Structures and Materials}

Don't worry, those courses are mostly: "here's an equation, know where to use them" (stress/strain, bending moments, density...)

\section{ESC101: Praxis I}
THERE IS NO PREPARING FOR PRAXIS! You are either good at it, or bad at it. I would assume why most people don't like this course is because:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unbalanced return on effort spent
    \item Grades are very subjective
    \item There's lots of writing
\end{enumerate}

\section{ESC103: Engineering Mathematics and Computation}

\section{ESC180: Intro to Computer Programming}

Computer is... computer. Your whole experience in computer will be split into:
\begin{itemize}
    \item I know programming: you can basically skip lectures and review for one day before midterm and be fine
    \item What is programming???: you might suffer in this course, but worry not, this course actually moves quite slow... you will catch up
\end{itemize}

\section{ESC194: Calculus I}

Calculus starts from basically defining what numbers are, though you do need basic trigonometry, e.g. the functions $\sin, \cos, \tan$, and how to evaluate them.

\section{PHY180: Classical Mechanics}

Physics is basic, you can probably pass the exam if you go into it like... right now?

\section{ESC102: Praxis II}

\section{ESC190: Computer Algorithms and Data Structures}

\section{ESC195: Calculus II}

\section{MAT185: Linear Algebra}

Linear algebra is new to everyone, nothing can really prepare you for it. Maybe knowing vectors will help? Try to get a sense of how matrix multiplication work in terms of "combination of rows/columns" instead of a literal: $a_1\times b_1 + a_2\times b_2\dots$ sense.

At the moment of writing, ChatGPT is still pretty bad with linear algebra, so don't use it for your homework or exams.

You can also drop this course and do MAT223 instead, the ArtSci (Faculty of Arts and Science) equivalent. Again, please check with the EngSci Office before doing that. This EngSci upper year would also like to kindly inform you that the course is garbage. It is boring and covers no new content, so you should not take it unless if it's for free.

\section{ECE159: Electric Circuits}

Circuit is fine. High school stuff (even including AP/IB) probably only covers the first 2-3 weeks max.

\section{MSE160: Molecules \& Materials}

Don't worry, those courses are mostly: "here's an equation, know where to use them" (stress/strain, bending moments, density...)
