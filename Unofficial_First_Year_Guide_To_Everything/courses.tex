\section{CIV102: Structures and Materials}

Don't worry, those courses are mostly: "here's an equation, know where to use them" (stress/strain, bending moments, density...)

\section{ESC101: Praxis I}
THERE IS NO PREPARING FOR PRAXIS! You are either good at it, or bad at it. I would assume why most people don't like this course is because:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unbalanced return on effort spent
    \item Grades are very subjective
    \item There's lots of writing
\end{enumerate}

\section{ESC103: Engineering Mathematics and Computation}

\section{ESC180: Intro to Computer Programming}

Computer is... computer. Your whole experience in computer will be split into:
\begin{itemize}
    \item I know programming: you can basically skip lectures and review for one day before midterm and be fine
    \item What is programming???: you might suffer in this course, but worry not, this course actually moves quite slow... you will catch up
\end{itemize}

\section{ESC194: Calculus I}

Calculus starts from basically defining what numbers are, though you do need basic trigonometry, e.g. the functions $\sin, \cos, \tan$, and how to evaluate them.

\section{PHY180: Classical Mechanics}

Physics is basic, you can probably pass the exam if you go into it like... right now?

\section{ESC102: Praxis II}

\section{ESC190: Computer Algorithms and Data Structures}

\section{ESC195: Calculus II}

\section{MAT185: Linear Algebra}

Linear algebra is new to everyone, nothing can really prepare you for it. Maybe knowing vectors will help? Try to get a sense of how matrix multiplication work in terms of "combination of rows/columns" instead of a literal: $a_1\times b_1 + a_2\times b_2\dots$ sense

\section{ECE159: Electric Circuits}

Circuit is fine. High school stuff (even including AP/IB) probably only covers the first 2-3 weeks max.

\section{MSE160: Molecules \& Materials}

Don't worry, those courses are mostly: "here's an equation, know where to use them" (stress/strain, bending moments, density...)
