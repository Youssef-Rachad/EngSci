### Unofficial First Year Guide To Everything

*I can't wait to promise everything and deliver nothing!*  
This is an **unofficial** guide for frosh as they enter EngSci. Here I'll include things I want to say but am not allowed to, and dumb jokes. You go figure out which is which.

#### I want to contribute

Make a PR (pull request). If you don't know LaTeX, that's fine too! Just put the text in the PR, and I'll do it for you.
