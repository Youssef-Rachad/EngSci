This is where you can find general academic advice that applies to courses in general.

\subsection{Petitions}

This is not an official UofT website telling you "it's okay to submit petitions". Submitting petitions is actually okay. In my year, people were submitting petitions left and right during midterm season for their lab reports. I've seen people with high 80 averages submitting petitions. Your mental health is more important, and have faith in the curve.

Stuff you can petition for via the \href{https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjZj-qeh-7-AhX-kokEHX8-C8YQFnoECA0QAQ&url=http\%3A\%2F\%2Fundergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca\%2Fskule-\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520life\%2Fthe-engineering-portal\%2F&usg=AOvVaw145xL8tAHUKBRq6D6rbDhS}{Engineering Portal}: All deliverables (assignments, lab reports, etc) and assessments (quizzes, midterms, finals). It doesn't matter if you're just too busy to prepare for it, or if you're just sick. At this time, you don't need to provide proof of illness. It is rumoured that you get one freebie for sleeping through assessments.

\section{Notetaking}

Obviously I am biased. I prefer LaTeX for the more mathy courses, and Markdown for the rest. I know a lot of people take notes on their tablets using apps such as OneNote, Notability, Notion, etc. You can also download and annotate lecture slides directly.
