This is where you can find general academic advice that applies to courses in general.

\subsection{Petitions}

This is not an official UofT website telling you "it's okay to submit petitions". Submitting petitions is actually okay. In my year, people were submitting petitions left and right during midterm season for their lab reports. I've seen people with high 80 averages submitting petitions. Your mental health is more important, and have faith in the curve.

Stuff you can petition for via the \href{https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjZj-qeh-7-AhX-kokEHX8-C8YQFnoECA0QAQ&url=http\%3A\%2F\%2Fundergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca\%2Fskule-\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520\%2520life\%2Fthe-engineering-portal\%2F&usg=AOvVaw145xL8tAHUKBRq6D6rbDhS}{Engineering Portal}: All deliverables (assignments, lab reports, etc) and assessments (quizzes, midterms, finals). It doesn't matter if you're just too busy to prepare for it, or if you're just sick. At this time, you don't need to provide proof of illness. It is rumoured that you get one freebie for sleeping through assessments.

\section{Notetaking}

Obviously I am biased. I prefer LaTeX for the more mathy courses, and Markdown for the rest. I know a lot of people take notes on their tablets using apps such as OneNote, Notability, Notion, etc. You can also download and annotate lecture slides directly. A third possibility is to take notes on paper. The advantages are that you never run into technical difficulties, though it might be harder to organise your notes and search for what you need.

\section{Summer Courses}

This is a great way to lighten your courseload. Check to see if you can drop courses during the term and take a similar/the same course in the summer. However, you can't do this for every course, e.g. ESC194/ESC195. You will also have to pay extra for summer courses. The nice thing about UofT is that starting second year, you can overload, meaning you can take more courses than necessary, for free! Some 2T4s (whose names shall not be mentioned) were mad enough to take 8 courses in second year. So now nobody else is allowed to (thanks). But you can take 1 extra course, i.e. 7 courses and second year, and in third year and beyond, a maximum of 4.25 credits, or 8.5 courses per semester. Some courses such as seminars count as half-courses. UofT doesn't care about conflicts too, so it is okay to take two courses that have lectures/tutorials at the same time. This is really cool.
