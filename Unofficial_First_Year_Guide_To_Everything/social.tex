\section{10 Things to Do in EngSci}

Someone with a higher GPA than me generously offered these wise words

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lower your expectations.
    \item Abandon all hope.
    \item Say goodbye to your social life.
    \item Say hello to anxiety, depression, whatever mental issues there are.
    \item Reconsider your life choices.
    \item Why are you even here?
    \item Why are you doing this to yourself?
    \item No, seriously, like, why do you hate yourself so much?
    \item Be crushed by the weight of your horrible life choices and the realization that life only goes downhill from here.
\end{enumerate}
