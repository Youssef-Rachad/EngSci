U of T mental health resources are useless and they only exists to prevent litigation. Please do not rely on it if you are ever in crisis.

With that being said, you can also book your own appointments with mental health practitioners. If you did not opt out of \href{https://studentcare.ca/plan/en-CA/IHaveAPlan_UTSU/understanding-my-coverage}{Studentcare} (mandatory for international students), you would be covered up to \$100 per visit and up to 15 visits a year.
