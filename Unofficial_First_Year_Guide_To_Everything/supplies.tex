Before coming into EngSci, you might wanna empty your parent's bank account just a bit more. As someone who is on the frugal side, here is some advice:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Textbooks
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Check with your professor to see if the textbook is actually used
            \item See if you can download it (legally)
            \item You can even print the relevant chapters out using your 900-per-term printing quota (they rarely use the whole book)
            \item In most cases, there isn't much difference between a newer and older edition. However, you should always check.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Laptops/Tablets
        \begin{itemize}
            \item You might wanna get one if you have neither. You need these for meetings (Praxis, Design Teams), homework, note-taking, etc. A laptop is better than a tablet.
            \item You don't need a new laptop just for better specs. Use Linux (I am typing this on a 10-year-old laptop). There are almost always outlets in lecture halls (ranging from one per seat to one per lecture hall), so battery life does not matter as much.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Pens, pencils, erasers, paper
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Cheap enough that it doesn't really matter.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
