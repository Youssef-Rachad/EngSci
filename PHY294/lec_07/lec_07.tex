\section{Electronic Paramagnet}

Continuing from our last lecture, we see total spin $S$ can be found as $2N_{\text{up}} - N$. Then
$$\Omega(N_{\text{up}},N) = \binom{N}{N_{\text{up}}} = \frac{N!}{(N-N_{\text{up}})!N_{\text{up}}!}$$
is the multiplicity function. 

\section{Einstein Solid}

This is a collection of $N$ simple harmonic oscillators in 3D (i.e. each atom has 3 degrees of freedom). Each oscillator has energy
$$E_n = \hbar\omega\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)$$
Then each microstate can be written as $\{n_1,\dots,n_N\}$ where $n_i \in \N$. Then total energy is
$$U = \hbar\omega\left(\frac{N}{2} + \sum_{i=1}^N n_i\right) = \hbar\omega\left(\frac{N}{2}+q\right)$$
where $q$ is defined as above, the total number of quanta.
$$\Omega(q,N) = \frac{(N-1+q)!}{(N-1)!q!}$$
Note the $-1$ term comes from the reduced degree of freedom (stars and banners).

\begin{ex}
	Consider two isolated states $N_A,q_A$ and $N_B,q_B$. Then, they are brought together, allowing energy to flow. Then
	$$q'_A + q'_B = q_{\text{total}}$$
	which is constant due to conservation of energy. Now total microstates is
	$$\Omega_{\text{total}} = \Omega_A(q'_A)\Omega_B(q'_B)$$
\end{ex}
