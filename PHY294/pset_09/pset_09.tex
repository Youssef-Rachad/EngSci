\begin{questions}

\question{Consider a system of two Einstein solids, $A$ and $B$, each containing 10 oscillators, sharing a total of 20 units of energy. Assume that the solids are weakly coupled, and that the total energy is fixed.}

\begin{parts}
	\part{How many different macrostates are available to this system?}
	\part{How many different microstates are available to this system?}
	\part{Assuming that this system is in thermal equilibrium, what is the probability of finding all the energy in solid $A$?}
	\part{What is the probability of finding exactly half of the energy in solid $A$?}
	\part{Under what circumstances would this system exhibit irreversible behavior?}
\end{parts}

\begin{solution}
	There are 21 macrostates
\end{solution}
