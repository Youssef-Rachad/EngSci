### JRE420: People Management and Organizational Behaviour

### PHY356: Philosophy of Physics

It touches on important philosophers of the past while also teaching you new philosophical problems we face today in physics. This is a small class, with a light course load with group discussions and a bit of essay writing. No philosophy background required.

### TEP444: Positive Psychology for Engineers

The prof wants to give out a high average (50% of the class gets an A-), you can submit assignments 6 days late and still get an A-, everything is just a reflection that takes 30 mins - 2 hrs depending on the grade you want, you go on various adventures with your group (toy store, AGO, cemetery) for each assignment, great course to meet new friends in. It is a bird course, but a fun course too.

### HIS244H1: Early Modern Europe, 1648-1815

Bird course.
