The prof wants to give out a high average (50% of the class gets an A-), you can submit assignments 6 days late and still get an A-, everything is just a reflection that takes 30 mins - 2 hrs depending on the grade you want, you go on various adventures with your group (toy store, AGO, cemetery) for each assignment, great course to meet new friends in. It is a bird course, but actually fun.
