## Reflexive Principism as an Effective Approach for Developint Ethical Reasoning in Engineering

### Introduction
Motivation:
- Case by case basis cannot go beyond existing codes
- Morel codes may not even be able to address newer technologies
- Engineers should develop ethics beyond those required by codes  

### Need for Ethical Reasoning in Engineering
- case based analysis
	- uncritical application of codes
	- analysis of risk and fault
- does not address emerging technological and societal advances

### Reflexive Principlism
- approach to moral reasoning based on framework of principles
- Four core principles
	- Respect for autonomy
	- Beneficence
	- Non maleficence
	- Justice
- Starts from a set of guidelines
- No need to reference cases

### Reflectivity
- we **constantly** and **consciously** reflect between our normative judgements and ethical principles
- Interplay between moral intuition and moral theory
- Addresses the contraints and limitations of codes and intuition
- "Reflect" on decisions, as opposed to "reflexive" decisions, or decisions made by "reflex"

### Specification
- Narrowing scope
	- e.g. What does justice mean here? To who does it impact?
- Avoids the metal trap of making principles absolute
	- usually a few conflicting principles
	- makes one more aware of other factors in play

### Justification
- Process by which coherence and completeness of an ethical reasoning decision is evaluated
- Top down (theory) and bottom up (case by case) approaches are insufficient

### Reasons to Support Reflexive Principlism
1. Efficiency
2. Uniquely aligned with the engineering design process (braxis)
3. It is developed in a context of professional practice that impacts people and the world directly
4. Covers common moral concerns relevant to engineers
5. Flexible and adaptive to concerns 
	- both theory and a case by case basis generate a source of "rules" that do not change with time
