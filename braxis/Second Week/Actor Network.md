## Notes on the Theory of the Actor Network: Ordering, Strategy and Heterogeneity

#### Introduction

Networks may seem like actors at times, e.g. the government is a network of systems and individuals, yet it is often addressed as a singular entity

#### Society as Heterogeneous Network

Knowledge: a product of bits and pieces of things  
Everything is an **ordered network** of materials whose resistance has been overcome, i.e. things are defined by their medium.

#### Agency as Network

Analytically treats humans and objects as the same, since **a person is an effect generated by a network of materials**, e.g. people are what they are because of their tools.  
Question: is an agent an agent because of intrinsic or extrinsic factors?  
Answer: Both factors cannot be denied. Everything is a network.

#### Punctualisation and Resourcing

We usually simplify networks into points, which is called **punctualisation**.

#### Translation: Social Ordering as Precarious Process

Social sructure is a verb, and there is no singular social structure.

#### The Strategies of Translation

Power is an effect and not a cause.

Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof.
